# My-C-journey
i asked ChatGPT to give me 100 C programs. these are the programs. 
This is the promt i used
"Give me a list of 100 C programming tasks, ordered from easiest to hardest. Just provide the name of each program along with a suggested file name. I’ll go through them one by one. If I have any questions or need help, I’ll ask — explain the logic when needed, but only give me the source code if I’m unable to complete the task myself. Keep track of which programs I’ve completed. Also, let me know what key concepts or elements I should use in each program. After 100 programs, ask me if I want more. And file names should be numbered to make it more organized."
